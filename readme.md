# Generated Keymap Hot Dox Layout

This layout was first generated by the QMK API. Because additional features like [Tap Dance](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/features/feature_tap_dance) ([Tutorial](https://thomasbaart.nl/2018/12/13/qmk-basics-tap-dance/)) have been used, it has to be manually maintained due to them not being supported by the [QMK Online Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/hotdox/LAYOUT_ergodox).

To make use of this keymap you will need follow the following steps:

* Download or Clone QMK Firmware: <https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/>
* Extract QMK Firmware to a location on your hard drive
* Copy this folder into `./qmk_firmware/keyboards/hotdox/keymaps/`
* You are now ready to compile (or flash) use your keymap with the source with `(sudo?) make hotdox:zonk(:flash)`

More information can be found in the QMK docs: <https://docs.qmk.fm>

## Generate ASCII Layout

You can see the complete layout with all layers visualized in ASCII art in the `layout.ascii` file. To generate this file, the [keymapviz tool](https://github.com/yskoht/keymapviz) is used. In case you don't have (or want) Python3 installed, you can run `docker-compose up` to in this folder to automatically generate this file. Remove remnants of the container with `docker-compose down`.

## Visualize keymap.c online

To visualize a keymap.c file with all its layers online in the browser, you can use the [keymapceditor](http://ciantic.github.io/keymapceditor/) tool.
